## Authentication
Set the `Authorization` header to the token generated by Google. Any request made without this header set will be denied. Any token not deemed valid by Google will also be denied. 

Note: Tokens seem have a expiration time of 1 hour.

## Routes
| **Endpoint** | **Response** |
|----|----|
| `/` | Redirect to `/api` |
| `/api` | List of API endpoints.<br>Currently only `/api/v1` |
| `/api/v1` | List of v1 endpoints.<br>Currently only `/api/v1/save` |
| `/api/v1/save` | Endpoint for storing data.<br>Required template in json_templates folder |

## Exceptions
Exceptions are automatically caught by middleware. Two custom exceptions have been defined, `ClientException` and `ServerException`. These exceptions are caught and the message is returned to the client with appropriate response codes.

All other exceptions are caught by a 'catch-all' and return a generic error message and the log is printed to the console.

## 404 Page Not Found
Any request that does not match a route is returned a custom 404 page.
